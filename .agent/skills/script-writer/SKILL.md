# Script Writer

This skill acts as an onboarding guide to drafting highly engaging content scripts. A good script relies on pacing and psychological hooks, rather than just delivering raw information.

## The Storytelling Pattern

When tasked with writing a blog post, a video script, or a presentation, always structure the narrative using the following 4-step framework.

### 1. The Opening (Story & Inspection)

Never start with dry facts.

- **The Hook:** Begin with a compelling personal story, an intriguing observation from daily life, or a relatable pain point.
- **The Inspection:** Immediately transition from the story into identifying the core "mystery" or problem. Why does this thing happen? Why is it frustrating? Make the audience feel understood.

### 2. The Body (Exploration)

Once the hook is set, deliver the core value.

- **Expand the Inspection:** Break down the facts, data, and arguments clearly.
- **Tone:** Keep it conversational but authoritative. Use short, punchy sentences. (For video scripts, include [Visual Cues] or [B-Roll Notes] in brackets).

### 3. The Climax (Turning Point)

This is where you shift the audience's perspective.

- After laying out the facts, introduce a **paradigm shift**. Reveal a new, unexpected way of thinking about the topic that changes the context of everything discussed in the Body.

### 4. The Ending (Inversion)

The final impression must be memorable.

- **The Inversion:** Conclude by flipping the original premise on its head. Offer a surprising twist or a counter-intuitive takeaway. End on a note that forces the audience to rethink their initial assumptions.
- Do not use generic conclusions like "In summary..." or "To wrap things up...".
