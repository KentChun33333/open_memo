Building on your success with Session-Memory, you’ve touched on the "Secret Sauce" of industrial agent design. In a professional setting, we move away from "chatting" and toward "System Engineering."If you want an agent that doesn't just work on your laptop but is robust enough for a production environment, here are the Top 10 Must-Have Requirements.1. State Checkpointing (Hydration/Dehydration)In production, agents crash, tokens time out, or the internet blips.The Requirement: Every time an agent completes a tool call, the Session State (CWD, artifacts, history) must be saved to a database (Redis/PostgreSQL).Why: This allows the agent to "resume" from Step 2 even if the system restarts, without re-running Step 1 (saving you money and time).2. Deterministic "Reality Checks"Never trust an agent’s word. If the agent says, "I have initialized the repo," the system shouldn't believe it until a non-LLM script confirms it.The Requirement: A Verification Layer that runs physical checks (e.g., os.path.exists) after every "Write" or "Init" action.3. Capability Scoping (Least Privilege)A "Coding Agent" should not have the delete_database tool.The Requirement: Strict Tool-to-Role Mapping. Each subagent only "sees" the tools it needs for its specific SOP step.Why: This prevents "Agent Drift," where an agent gets confused and tries to fix a bug by re-installing the entire OS.4. Structured Handover SchemasWhen Agent A (Ops) finishes, it shouldn't just "talk" to Agent B (Coder). It must pass a JSON Handover Object.The Requirement: A standard schema containing: active_directory, generated_files[], environment_vars, and current_status.5. Token Pruning & Context ManagementAs the agent works, the context window fills up with junk (installation logs, etc.).The Requirement: An Auto-Summarizer that "squeezes" old logs into a short summary, keeping the "Active Context" (CWD and Current Goal) crystal clear.6. Error-Reconciliation LoopsWhen a tool fails, most amateur agents just say, "I am sorry."The Requirement: The system must feed the Raw Error Trace (Stderr) back to the agent with a "Self-Correction" instruction.Why: This allows the agent to see that npm install failed because of a version mismatch and fix it itself.7. Atomic Task Decomposition (SOP Locking)The agent should be "locked" into the current step.The Requirement: The Orchestrator must prevent the agent from calling "Bundle" tools while the current state is "Develop."The Tool: Use a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control which agent/tools are active.8. Telemetry & Audit TraceabilityIn industry, you need to know why an agent made a decision three hours ago.The Requirement: A Centralized Logger that records: Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Global State Change.9. Latency Management (Parallel vs. Sequential)If Step 2 involves writing 5 files, a professional agent shouldn't write them one by one.The Requirement: Batch Tool Calling. The architecture should support the agent sending 5 write_file requests in a single turn.10. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) BreakpointsFor high-risk actions (like scripts/bundle-artifact.sh), you need a "Safe Mode."The Requirement: A Pause-and-Approve gate where the Orchestrator stops and waits for a human to click "OK" before the agent executes a destructive or final command.Top 10 Summary TableRequirementCategoryProfessional GoalState CheckpointingPersistenceResilience against crashes.Deterministic ChecksValidationElimination of hallucinations.Capability ScopingSecurityPrevention of accidental damage.Structured HandoverCommunicationSeamless Agent-to-Agent flow.Token PruningOptimizationKeeping the "Brain" focused.ReconciliationSelf-CorrectionAutonomous bug fixing.SOP LockingControlPreventing step-skipping.TelemetryDebuggingUnderstanding "The Why."ParallelismPerformanceSpeeding up execution.HITL BreakpointsSafetyHuman oversight on critical steps.
