[Wed 2026-02-18 21:40 GMT+8] how can i access via web
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] To connect to OpenClaw through a web interface, open the webchat client in your browser and navigate to the URL where your instance is hosted (for a local setup this is usually something like `http://localhost:8080` or the address shown in your gateway’s configuration). Once you’re on that page you’ll be prompted to log in with the credentials you use for OpenClaw, after which you can chat, issue commands, and manage agents just as you would through other channels. If you need help finding the exact URL or setting up the web client, let me know!

[Wed 2026-02-18 21:43 GMT+8] can you change model to ollama/qwen3-coder-next
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] I’m currently configured to use only the models listed in the system’s configuration—right now that’s the `nemotron-3-nano:latest` model served by Ollama. The model you mentioned (`ollama/qwen3-coder-next`) isn’t part of the allowed list, so I can’t switch to it until the configuration is updated. If you’d like me to add that model (or any other changes) I can do so, but I’ll need your explicit permission before updating the config. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
