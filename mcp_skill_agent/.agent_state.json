      "feedback": "[REJECTED]\n\n**Feedback and required fixes:**\n\n1. **Missing shadcn/ui components** \u2013 The code does not import any pre\u2011installed Shadcn UI component (e.g., `import { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\"`). All interactive elements should be built with Shadcn UI components to satisfy the skill\u2019s requirement of \u201cOnly Use pre\u2011installed shadcn/ui components\u201d.\n\n2. **Non\u2011Tailwind styling** \u2013 Buttons and layout use unnamed class names like `\"card\"` and `\"btn\"` that are likely defined in external CSS. The skill mandates applying Tailwind utility classes directly (e.g., `className=\"rounded-md bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white\"`). Replace custom class references with proper Tailwind utilities.\n\n3. **Asset import without validation** \u2013 `reactLogo` is imported from `\"./assets/react.svg\"` but no verification exists that the asset file (or base\u201164 inline version) is present or handled by Vite\u2019s asset pipeline. Ensure any external assets are either inlined as base64 data URIs or referenced correctly within the generated project.\n\n4. **Design\u2010guideline violations** \u2013 The markup includes a simple top\u2011centered layout with generic rounded corners and solid background colors, which can drift toward \u201cAI slop\u201d. Adopt the style guidance: avoid excessive centered layouts, uniform rounded corners, purple gradients, and the Inter font. Use Tailwind\u2019s design tokens to create distinctive styling.\n\n5. **Unused initialization steps** \u2013 The skill requires running `scripts/init-artifact.sh` first, then editing generated code in Step\u202f2 before bundling with `bundle-artifact.sh`. No evidence of these steps exists yet; run them to set up the Vite project (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) and ensure proper path aliases (`@/`) are configured.\n\n6. **Missing self\u2011contained artifact** \u2013 The current file is only a component module (`App.tsx`). To be shareable as an MCP artifact, it must eventually be bundled into the single `bundle.html` generated by `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`. Ensure all dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI) are correctly resolved before bundling.\n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Initialize a new project with `scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>`.  \n- Replace the current component with one that uses Shadcn UI components and Tailwind utilities.  \n- Validate assets or replace them with base64\u2011encoded SVGs.  \n- Run `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` to produce the final single HTML file for sharing.\n\nOnce these changes are applied, re\u2011submit the updated `src/App.tsx` (and any related files) for re\u2011audit.",

      "feedback": "[REJECTED]\n\n**Issues requiring fixes:**\n\n1. **Wrong project context**  \n   - The artifact is being developed in `/mcp_skill_agent/src/` but the Expectation refers to `/mcp-visualizer/src/App.tsx` (the MCP Visualizer demo). Working in the wrong folder will cause bundling and routing mismatches.\n\n2. **Missing required functionality**  \n   - The current `App.tsx` only contains a simple counter example and does not implement any of the MCP\u2011Visualizer features that were outlined:\n     * No connection dialog / workspace URI handling.  \n     * No \u201cShow Prompt List\u201d or \u201cExecute Sample Code\u201d actions.  \n     * No integration with the `mcp-visualizer` library (`init`, `render`) needed to expose prompts and execute code.\n\n3. **Incorrect component usage**  \n   - The instructions require using pre\u2011installed **shadcn/ui** components (e.g., `import { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\"`). The file uses plain HTML `<button>` elements instead of shadcn UI components, violating the \u201cuse only shadcn UI\u201d rule.\n\n4. **Missing or incorrect imports/assets**  \n   - It imports `reactLogo` from `\"./assets/react.svg\"` but no such asset has been verified to exist in the repository; unresolved static asset imports will break bundling.  \n   - No import of the MCP\u2011Visualizer SDK (`import init, { render } \u2026`) is present.\n\n5. **Styling and layout concerns**  \n   - While Tailwind classes are used, the design contains typical \u201cAI slop\u201d patterns (centered layout with generic rounded corners) that should be avoided according to the style guidelines. More purposeful styling aligned with the MCP\u2011Visualizer narrative is required.\n\n6. **Incomplete code structure**  \n   - The component\u2019s JSX is not fully closed (`<p>` tag duplicated, missing closing tags for certain elements), and there are stray curly braces in the imported worker output that were never completed \u2013 indicating the file is an unfinished draft rather than a ready\u2011to\u2011bundle artifact.\n\n7. **Path/export mismatch**  \n   - The file exports `App` as default but does not wrap it with the necessary Vite/PARCEL configuration or entry\u2011point (`main.tsx`) that bootstraps React in a shadcn/vite project; for bundling, the root component must be located at `src/main.tsx`, not just `src/App.tsx`.\n\n**Suggested corrective steps (in order):**\n\n1. Create/modify the file at **`/mcp-visualizer/src/App.tsx`**, following the scaffold generated by `scripts/init-artifact.sh`.  \n2. Replace the current simple counter UI with a full\u2011featured layout that includes:  \n   * A connection dialog using shadcn UI components and state for `connectionUri`.  \n   * Sections to show prompt list, execute sample code, and any other required demos.  \n3. Import and use **shadcn/ui** components (`Button`, `Dialog`, `Input`, etc.) exclusively.  \n4. Add the MCP\u2011Visualizer imports: `import init from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/microsoft/mcp-visualizer@latest/dist/index.mjs\";` and call `render({ \u2026 })`.  \n5. Ensure any static assets (e.g., logos) are placed under `/public/` or imported as SVGs within the component to avoid unresolved imports.  \n6. Verify Tailwind classes adhere to design guideline expectations\u2014avoid generic centered containers with purple gradients; use purposeful layout.  \n7. Run `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` after completion and confirm that the generated `bundle.html` renders without console errors.\n\nAddressing these points should satisfy both functional and packaging requirements, leading to an [APPROVED] outcome.",
