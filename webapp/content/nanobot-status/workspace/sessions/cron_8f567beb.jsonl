Key observations:\n\n### Content Patterns\n- **Agent architecture focus** (60%+): MCP skill agents, agentic loops, memory systems, eval frameworks\n- **Wealth-building** (1 post): The Feb 14 wealth plan is present (1644 bytes)\n- **Recent daily summaries** (Feb 25): Suggest active documentation habits\n\n### Gaps Identified\n1. **No Feb 20-23 content** (3 days missing between Feb 19 and Feb 24)\n2. **Feb 23 post exists** but no Feb 25 content beyond the daily summary\n3. **Wealth-building post** exists but may need expansion per your $2M\u2192$30M plan\n\n### Next Steps\n\n| Priority | Action | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **High** | Continue daily summaries | Consistent cadence maintained; Feb 25 summary exists |\n| **Medium** | Expand wealth-building content | $2M\u2192$30M plan needs execution steps documented |\n| **Medium** | Fill gap dates (Feb 20-23) | Review cron logs/HISTORY.md to identify missed topics |\n| **Low** | Content categorization | Tag posts by theme (agent architecture, wealth, skills) |\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Review HISTORY.md to identify what happened on Feb 20-23?\n2. Expand the wealth-building post with more specific implementation steps?\n3.
