For the content, I have two options:\n\n1. **Auto-generate daily briefings** based on the Feb 25 action plan (pulling relevant sections)\n2. **Send a summary** of the existing wealth-building content with daily execution steps\n\nWhich approach would you prefer?\n\nAlso, should the daily briefing include:\n- Today's actionable task from the action plan?\n- Market updates (SGX, S&P 500, interest rates)?\n- Wealth metric tracking (net worth, passive income)?\n\nLet me know and I'll set up the cron job accordingly.", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T10:29:27.369415", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "grep", "read_file", "read_file", "exec"]}
