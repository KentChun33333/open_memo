{"role": "assistant", "content": "I've reviewed both blogs. Here's my analysis and next steps:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Blog Status:**\n- Feb 25: Daily summary that *references* the Feb 14 wealth post (no new wealth content)\n- Feb 14: Only wealth-building post with full $2M\u2192$30M framework\n\n**Gap Identified:** No recent wealth-building content since Feb 14 (~11 days ago), despite your memory indicating \"wealth-building content exists.\"\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI recommend:\n\n1. **Create today's wealth briefing** (Feb 25) that expands on the Feb 14 framework with:\n   - Recent market updates (Singapore equities, property trends)\n   - Actionable next steps for Phase 1 (Foundation)\n   - Singapore-specific opportunities (CPF, S-REITs, local startups)\n\n2. **Set up recurring wealth briefings** via cron to ensure consistent content\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Write today's wealth briefing post now?\n- Schedule recurring weekly/monthly wealth briefings?\n- Focus on a specific aspect (SaaS business, investment execution, etc.)?", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T10:03:57.697155", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "exec", "read_file", "read_file"]}
