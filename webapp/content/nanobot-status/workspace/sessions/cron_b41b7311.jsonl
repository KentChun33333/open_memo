{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my review of the blogs, I can see:\n\n1. **Today's daily summary already exists** (`2026-02-25-daily-summary.mdx`) with comprehensive wealth-building content\n2. The wealth-building strategy is well-documented with the $2M\u2192$30M roadmap\n3. The cron job for daily summaries appears to be active (per memory: \"Cron job ID: 758bcb3d active daily at 7:30 AM SGT\")\n\n## Next Steps Decision\n\nSince the daily summary cron job is already configured and working (it created today's summary), I should:\n\n1. **Verify the cron job is properly set up** to continue running daily\n2. **Consider if you want to modify** the summary format or content focus\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Check the current cron job configuration?\n- Review the cron skill documentation to modify the schedule or content?\n- Create a custom script to generate more targeted wealth-building suggestions?\n\nLet me know your preference!", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T09:58:41.152778", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "read_file", "read_file"]}
