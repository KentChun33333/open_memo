{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my review of the blog content, here's the assessment and next steps:\n\n## Yesterday's Blog Summary (Feb 25)\nThe most recent blog provides a comprehensive **$2M \u2192 $30M Action Plan** with:\n- Current phase: Foundation (Months 1-6)\n- Key focus areas: Emergency fund, low-risk allocation (30%), equities (50%), SaaS business, physical assets\n- Specific February 2026 tasks mapped out\n\n## Wealth-Building Suggestions for Today\n\n### 1. Emergency Fund Review (Immediate)\n- Check current liquid savings against 6-month target ($50K-75K)\n- If short, prioritize building this before other allocations\n\n### 2. SSB/FD Optimization (High Priority)\n- **Today**: Check current FD rates at DBS/OCBC\n- **This Week**: Ladder maturities to capture ~3.3-3.8% p.a.\n- **This Month**: Set up SSB account if not already\n\n### 3. SaaS Business Execution (Medium-High Priority)\n- Your compliance AI expertise is your strongest asset\n- **Priority**: Automated STR drafting agent (highest ROI potential)\n- **Action**: Document 3 compliance pain points from yesterday's work\n\n### 4. Gold SIP Setup (Easy Win)\n- OCBC Riggs account with monthly SIP ($500-1K)\n- Simple to implement, provides inflation hedge\n\n## Recommendation: Focus on SaaS Momentum\nGiven your background in compliance AI at OCBC, the **Automated STR Drafting Agent** is the most viable SaaS idea. Your recent work on this is already proven - leverage that directly.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Create a detailed product spec for the STR drafting agent?\n2. Set up a reminder to review emergency fund status?\n3. Schedule time for SaaS development this week?", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T11:31:12.792907", "tools_used": ["read_file", "list_dir", "read_file", "read_file"]}
