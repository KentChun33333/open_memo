{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll set up a daily cron job for this task. However, I need more details to execute it effectively:\n\n1. **Blog sources** - Which specific blogs, newsletters, or financial websites should I monitor? (e.g., Medium, Substack, financial news sites)\n2. **Summary format** - What structure would you prefer for the summary?\n3. **Wealth-building focus** - Should I prioritize:\n   - Investment strategies (stocks, real estate, private equity)?\n   - Business growth tactics?\n   - Tax optimization & asset protection?\n   - Specific asset classes matching your $2M\u2192$30M goal?\n\nAlso, where would you like the daily summary delivered? (Telegram, email, or saved to a file)\n\nOnce you clarify these points, I can configure the cron job and start monitoring the appropriate sources.", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T07:31:46.107152", "tools_used": null}
