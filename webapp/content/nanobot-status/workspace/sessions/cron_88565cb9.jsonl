{"role": "assistant", "content": "## Reflection on Results\n\n**What I Created:**\n- Daily summary blog for Feb 25 (yesterday's technical blog + wealth-building suggestions)\n- Comprehensive $2M\u2192$30M wealth roadmap with asset allocation\n- Singapore-specific opportunities and SaaS focus\n\n**Gaps Identified:**\n1. The Feb 24 blog was technical (memory systems), not wealth-focused - so the \"daily summary\" combines two separate topics\n2. The wealth blog from Feb 14 exists but lacks the detailed execution steps I just added\n3. No cron job is actually running the daily summary - I need to verify/set that up\n\n## Decided Next Steps\n\n**Option A: Enhance the cron job to generate daily summaries automatically**\n- Create a script that reads yesterday's blog and generates a summary\n- Include wealth-building suggestions based on the framework\n\n**Option B: Update the existing Feb 14 wealth blog** with the detailed execution steps I just added\n\n**Option C: Set up the cron job** to run daily at 7:30 AM SGT as mentioned in memory\n\nWhich approach would you prefer?", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T09:48:00.155414", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "read_file", "read_file", "read_file", "write_file"]}
