{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my review, here's the current status and next steps:\n\n## Current Status Analysis\n\n**What we have:**\n- \u2705 Wealth-building roadmap blog (`2026-02-14-wealth-building-from-2m-to-30m.mdx`) - comprehensive asset allocation framework\n- \u2705 Daily summary blog (`2026-02-25-daily-summary.mdx`) - already exists with wealth-building content\n- \u2705 Cron job ID: 758bcb3d - active daily at 7:30 AM SGT\n- \u2705 Directory confirmed at `/Users/kentchiu/.nanobot/workspace/openmemo/webapp/content/blogs`\n\n**What's missing:**\n- \u274c A script to automatically generate the daily summary at 7:30 AM\n- \u274c Integration with the cron job to pull yesterday's blogs and generate wealth-building suggestions\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'll create an automated daily summary generator that:\n1. Reads yesterday's blogs (excluding today's date)\n2. Extracts wealth-building insights\n3. Generates actionable suggestions for the reader\n4. Saves to `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-summary.mdx`\n\n**Proposed implementation:**\n1. Create a Python script to generate daily summaries\n2. Update the cron job to use this script\n3. Test with a dry run\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating the automated daily summary generator?", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T09:46:44.858226", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "read_file", "run_shell_command", "exec", "read_file", "read_file", "exec", "exec"]}
