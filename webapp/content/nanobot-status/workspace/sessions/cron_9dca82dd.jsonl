{"role": "assistant", "content": "## Analysis of Results\n\n**What I found:**\n- The most recent wealth-specific blog is from **Feb 14, 2026** (`2026-02-14-wealth-building-from-2m-to-30m.mdx`)\n- Yesterday's blog (Feb 24) was technical: \"Building an Advanced Agentic Memory System with LanceDB Pro\"\n- No wealth-related content was published yesterday\n\n**Key Gap Identified:**\nThe Feb 14 wealth roadmap is comprehensive but **static** - it's a one-time framework without daily/weekly tracking elements or market updates.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps Recommendation\n\nI propose creating a **Daily Wealth Briefing** system that:\n\n1. **Summarizes market-moving news** (Singapore/ASEAN focus)\n2. **Tracks progress** against your $2M\u2192$30M roadmap\n3. **Provides actionable suggestions** based on current conditions\n\nWould you like me to:\n- \u2705 **Create a new daily wealth briefing template** for your blog directory?\n- \u2705 **Schedule a recurring task** to generate daily briefings?\n- \u2705 **Build a tracking dashboard** (simple markdown or interactive) for your wealth journey?\n\nWhich approach would you prefer?", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T09:55:03.831844", "tools_used": ["list_dir", "read_file", "read_file"]}
