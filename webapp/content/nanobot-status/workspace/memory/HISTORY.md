[2026-02-19 17:02-17:50] missing API keys for Brave Search and internal LLM XML syntax error. Alternative approach using NASDAQ fetches returned no results. User asked for accessible folders, and nanobot listed workspace contents. nanobot confirmed `voice-transcribe` skill installation but noted missing dependencies (`uv` and `.env` with OpenAI API key). User stated environment was already set and requested direct testing of step 3 (running transcribe script).
[2026-02-19 18:37] User requested to run the openmemo-git-update.sh script. Assistant previously confirmed success of local Whisper voice transcription (base model, ~3.9s load and inference), and outlined next steps including testing diverse voice samples, model selection, integration with memory/skill workflow, and preprocessing enhancements. The user's request indicates readiness to proceed with git updates for the open_memo repo, aligning with the known procedural rule to use the skill and run the script when asked to git update open_memo.

[2026-02-19 19:16] User requested setup of a cron job to run daily at 8:30 AM to summarize big news from https://reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence. This follows a successful update of the `open_memo` repository with nanobot architecture documentation and completion of local Whisper voice transcription testing. The task implies integration with web search tools (currently blocked due to missing API keys) and requires either a custom script leveraging `curl`/`requests` or a skill that can fetch and summarize web content.
