[2026-02-19 17:02-17:50] missing API keys for Brave Search and internal LLM XML syntax error. Alternative approach using NASDAQ fetches returned no results. User asked for accessible folders, and nanobot listed workspace contents. nanobot confirmed `voice-transcribe` skill installation but noted missing dependencies (`uv` and `.env` with OpenAI API key). User stated environment was already set and requested direct testing of step 3 (running transcribe script).
[2026-02-19 18:37] User requested to run the openmemo-git-update.sh script. Assistant previously confirmed success of local Whisper voice transcription (base model, ~3.9s load and inference), and outlined next steps including testing diverse voice samples, model selection, integration with memory/skill workflow, and preprocessing enhancements. The user's request indicates readiness to proceed with git updates for the open_memo repo, aligning with the known procedural rule to use the skill and run the script when asked to git update open_memo.

[2026-02-19 19:16] User requested setup of a cron job to run daily at 8:30 AM to summarize big news from https://reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence. This follows a successful update of the `open_memo` repository with nanobot architecture documentation and completion of local Whisper voice transcription testing. The task implies integration with web search tools (currently blocked due to missing API keys) and requires either a custom script leveraging `curl`/`requests` or a skill that can fetch and summarize web content.

[2026-02-19 19:16] Successfully created a daily cron job (ID: bfd4c3bf) to run at 8:30 AM Vancouver time, summarizing AI news from Reuters. The job targets the Reuters AI technology page (https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) with fallback options if scraping fails. User confirmed to proceed with updating long-term memory and manually testing the summarize action immediately after setup. Next steps included verifying the URL stability, logging summaries to memory/MEMORY.md, and implementing robust error handling with fallbacks to web search tools if needed.

[2026-02-19 19:24] System detected that direct HTML scraping of Reuters AI news page (https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) returns 401 Forbidden. Assistant proposed three fallback strategies: (1) use Reuters search endpoint (https://www.reuters.com/search/news?blob=artificial+intelligence), (2) fallback to Google News (https://news.google.com/search?q=artificial%20intelligence...), or (3) use web_search tools if API keys are added later. At 19:27, user confirmed to proceed with the endpoint, implying adoption of the search-based approach for the Reuters AI news summarization cron job.

[2026-02-19 20:29] User requested execution of the openmemo-git-update.sh script to commit and push architecture documentation changes to the open_memo repository. Prior to this, the system confirmed Reuters direct scraping is blocked (401 Forbidden), and a fallback plan using the Reuters search endpoint (https://www.reuters.com/search/news?blob=artificial+intelligence) had been implemented starting 2026-02-19, with Google News as secondary fallback. The user’s system — macOS arm64, Python 3.13.5, uv-installed — is fully configured for test execution and automation tasks.

[2026-02-19T20:29] User requested a git update of the `open_memo` repo via `openmemo-git-update.sh`. ASSISTANT initially reported the repo was already up to date, but USER corrected that the report is continually evolving and implied pending changes. This indicates active, ongoing documentation updates in the repo that require further investigation or manual sync beyond the auto-detected state.

[2026-02-19T21:19] User requested a single-script git update for the open_memo repo. The assistant confirmed execution of `openmemo-git-update.sh`, but subsequent validation revealed uncommitted changes (e.g., `nanobot_architecture_analysis.md`, `nanobot-architecture.json`, `memory/MEMORY.md`) remained untracked or unstaged, indicating prior sync attempts (including at 20:29 and 20:32) did not fully reflect local changes. Further investigation is required to identify and commit/push pending edits.

[2026-02-19T21:19] Assistant analyzed `open_memo` git status and discovered 160+ uncommitted deletions of deprecated/test/demo folders (`gmimini-mcpllm-demo/`, `mcp-server-example/`). Assistant proposed staging, committing, and pushing these deletions to clean the repo, and requested user confirmation. At [2026-02-19T21:20] user approved to proceed. This follows earlier issues ([2026-02-19T20:32], [2026-02-19T21:19]) where `openmemo-git-update.sh` failed to stage new or modified files, prompting realization that the script omits `git add .` and manual staging is required for full sync.

[2026-02-19T21:20] User confirmed presence of a custom script in workspace to handle git sync of open_memo repo, noting it includes `cp` steps beyond standard `git add/commit/push`. Assistant had proposed manual staging of 160+ deprecated demo files (`gmimini-mcpllm-demo/`, `mcp-server-example/`) but deferred to user’s existing script. User explicitly requested use of the workspace script, indicating it contains necessary file-copy operations prior to git sync. This implies script is tailored for repo state management and should be used instead of ad-hoc git commands.

[2026-02-19T21:21] Assistant identified that the `open_memo-git-update.sh` script failed due to running from incorrect working directory (`/Users/kentchiu/.nanobot/workspace` instead of `/Users/kentchiu/Documents/Github/open_memo`), causing a 'not a git repository' error. User clarified the script is path-agnostic and uses `cd` internally to navigate to the correct repo directory, and requested direct execution with `bash`. Assistant confirmed script execution was pending user command to proceed.

[2026-02-19T21:23] Assistant executed `open_memo-git-update.sh` successfully after resolving issues with uncommitted changes; the script committed 86 files (+4 insertions, -11,555 deletions), removed deprecated demo directories, synced latest nanobot data (cron jobs, memory) to `webapp/content/nanobot-status`, and pushed to `origin/main`. User confirmed preference for using this custom sync script—instead of manual `git add/commit/push`—because it includes `cp` steps to prepare files (e.g., architecture docs, memory updates) before version control operations. Script is path-agnostic and expects invocation from outside the repo directory (e.g., `bash open_memo-git-update.sh` from workspace root).

[2026-02-19T21:43] User requested git update for the `open_memo` repo using skill scripts. Assistant previously executed `open_memo-git-update.sh` at 21:21, which successfully committed 86 files (net -11,555 deletions, +4 insertions), removed deprecated demo folders (`gmimini-mcpllm-demo/`, `mcp-server-example/`), synced nanobot status to `webapp/content/nanobot-status`, and pushed to `origin/main`. The script is path-agnostic, uses internal `cd` to the repo root (`/Users/kentchiu/Documents/Github/open_memo`), and expects to be invoked from outside the repo directory. It also includes custom `cp` steps for copying architecture docs and memory updates before syncing. User confirmed preference for using this script over manual git operations.

[2026-02-19T21:43] Assistant analyzed workspace structure and incorrectly concluded no `open_memo-git-update.sh` script exists in the workspace; however, user corrected that a skill-level `update.sh` should exist in the workspace `skills/` directory. Assistant offered to recreate the script or run `git pull`, but user explicitly requested verification of an existing skill-based update script in the workspace.

[2026-02-19T21:48] Assistant executed the open_memo repo update via skill script, successfully committing 2 files (+13 insertions, -7 deletions) and pushing to origin/main with commit ID ab763caa. The script synced nanobot data—including cron jobs and memory—into the webapp’s content structure. User later requested another update (21:56), indicating continued need for automation via skill-level scripts (e.g., `skills/update.sh`) rather than manual git actions. Prior context confirms a custom sync script exists in the workspace that performs file copying before git operations and expects to be run from outside the repo directory.

[2026-02-19T21:56] Assistant analyzed the `update-open-memo` skill and discovered that while `SKILL.md` references `./scripts/update.sh`, no `scripts/` folder exists in `/Users/kentchiu/.nanobot/workspace/skills/update-open-memo/`. Assistant prepared to create the missing script or run commands manually, but user corrected that scripts should already be present. This follows earlier context (21:48) confirming a skill-level `update.sh` in the `skills/` directory (not under individual skills) is used for `open_memo` repo updates.

[2026-02-19 21:58] Open_memo repository successfully updated via `skills/update.sh`: committed changes (d38be36f), pushed to origin/main, syncing cron-jobs.json and MEMORY.md to webapp/content/nanobot-status/. User confirmed script is path-agnostic and functioning reliably. Voice transcription skill was installed and tested locally; Reuters AI news cron job remains pending pending fallback to Google News. At [2026-02-19 23:50], user requested another git update of open_memo repo using skill scripts, indicating continued reliance on the top-level update.sh automation.

[2026-02-19 23:58] User requested to update the open_memo repo using skill scripts again. The assistant confirmed the last successful update at 21:58 (commit d38be36f), and reiterated that the top-level `skills/update.sh` script handles syncing `open_memo`, including committing and pushing changes to `origin/main`. The assistant reiterated availability to proceed with optional next steps: updating `MEMORY.md`, setting up Reuters fallback (Google News), and implementing voice-to-memory pipeline.

[2026-02-20 00:37] User requested another open_memo repo sync via the skill script; the assistant executed `skills/update.sh`, which successfully committed and pushed changes to `origin/main`. The latest commit `8129d1a5` (2026-02-19T21:58) included significant updates: new backend router `webapp/backend/routers/notes.py`, frontend components `NoteList.jsx` and `NotePost.jsx`, `package-lock.json`, Python cache files, cron job configurations, and nanobot status data—indicating active development of a notes/idea management feature for KentChiu. The user reaffirmed trust in the automated sync mechanism over manual git operations.

[2026-02-20T00:39] User requested to use skill scripts again for git update of the open_memo repo. Prior to this, at 2026-02-20T00:37, the assistant confirmed successful sync of the open_memo repo via `skills/update.sh`, commit `8129d1a5`, with 18 files changed (+436 insertions, -150 deletions). Key additions included new backend router `webapp/backend/routers/notes.py`, frontend pages `NoteList.jsx` and `NotePost.jsx`, `package-lock.json`, Python cache `notes.cpython-313.pyc`, and cron/nanobot status data. User had previously confirmed preference for using `skills/update.sh` over manual git commands.

[2026-02-20T07:57] User requested a web search for 'leu stock price'. Prior to this, at 00:39, the open_memo repo was successfully updated to commit 8aa8e291, including the new Reuters AI cron job config file `cron_bfd4c3bf.jsonl` (Vancouver time 8:30 AM). The assistant outlined next steps including testing Reuters fallback via Google News (since direct scraping yields 401), updating the cron job script to use Google News, and logging the session—though no updates had yet been executed at the time of the user's query. The voice-to-memory pipeline and notes feature remain pending.

[2026-02-20T07:57] User requested web search for 'leu stock price'; assistant identified likely causes: SearxNG backend error, ambiguous ticker (Cameco Corp trades as LEU on TSX but as CCO on NASDAQ, with no major U.S. ticker LEU), and provided next steps including clarifying company, rephrasing search, or using financial APIs. At [2026-02-20T08:02] user responded indicating SearxNG was fixed and requested to retry the search.

[2026-02-20T08:02] ASSISTANT identified a likely SearxNG misconfiguration causing a 308 Permanent Redirect error when handling web_search calls, suspecting URL routing issues between / and /search endpoints; recommended steps included verifying the service at http://localhost:8085, testing the /search endpoint directly in browser, and reviewing config files; by [2026-02-20T08:38] USER confirmed SearxNG is working again and requested a new search, leading to a successful reattempt of the 'leu stock price' query with no further issues identified.

[2026-02-20T08:38] SearxNG restored and successfully executed 'LEU stock price' query, returning Cameco Corporation (TSX: LEU) at $19.27, a uranium producer in the nuclear energy sector; [2026-02-20T08:54] User requested git update of open_memo repo via skill scripts to incorporate recent changes.

[2026-02-20T08:54] Open_memo repo updated via skill script with commit 8aa8e291, pushing 6 files (+32 insertions, -13 deletions) including new cron config file cron_bfd4c3bf.jsonl for Reuters AI cron job; at 09:03, user requested another git update to reflect recent updates, indicating active maintenance and iterative refinement of the repo. Skill status report confirmed working: update-open-memo, voice-transcribe (local Whisper), cron (daily 8:30 AM Reuters AI pending fallback), and web_search (SearxNG restored).

[2026-02-20T09:03] Open_memo repo updated via skill script: commit 8aa8e291 pushed to origin/main with 6 files changed (+32 insertions, -13 deletions); new cron job config file cron_bfd4c3bf.jsonl added for Reuters AI summary (scheduled daily 8:30 AM Vancouver time); skills confirmed operational including update-open-memo, voice-transcribe (local Whisper, ~3.9s latency), cron, and web_search (SearxNG restored); user continues tracking LEU (Cameco Corp, TSX: LEU) at $19.27 as part of nuclear energy/uranium sector interest; at 09:05 user indicated 'There is new update', prompting no further action yet.

[2026-02-20 09:07] User requested a new update of the open_memo repository via the skill script. The assistant had previously confirmed the successful update (commit 8aa8e291) and push to origin/main, including the new cron config file `cron_bfd4c3bf.jsonl` for Reuters AI cron job (scheduled daily 8:30 AM Vancouver time). No further details were provided by the user, and the assistant prepared to re-execute the update.

[2026-02-20T09:07] Open_memo repo was successfully updated via a skill script: nanobot data (cron/ and workspace/) synced to webapp/content/nanobot-status/, all changes staged and committed (default message 'update'), and pushed to origin/main. At 09:10, the user requested to 'Run the script', prompting the assistant to re-execute the update process — resulting in no new changes, same commit hash (8aa8e291), and confirmation of re-trigger.

[2026-02-20T09:10] The 'update-open-memo' script executed successfully, syncing nanobot data from ~/.nanobot/cron/ and ~/.nanobot/workspace/ to webapp/content/nanobot-status/, then ran git add . and found no staged changes, exiting cleanly with 'No changes to commit.' At 09:12, the user requested to 'update git updat on repo open_memo', prompting a follow-up to verify git status and consider manual checks or logging to MEMORY.md.

[2026-02-20T09:12-09:13] ASSISTANT analyzed git status showing 7 changes across 4 modified files (webapp/README.md, webapp/backend/config.py, webapp/backend/main.py, webapp/frontend/src/components/ReflectionAgent.jsx) and 4 untracked files/directories (searxng-tool/, and three new notes under webapp/content/notes/). ASSISTANT proposed staging, committing with a descriptive message, and pushing to main. USER responded with 'Use the skill in workspace', prompting execution of the git sync commands.
