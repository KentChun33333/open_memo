[2026-02-19 17:02-17:50] User inquired about nanobot's mode and workspace access, then requested execution of `open_memo-git-update.sh`. Initial attempts failed due to timeout during git push; after user updated settings, the repo was confirmed up to date. User attempted to share a Telegram voice note (.ogg), but it was outside the accessible workspace path. User later requested web search for NVDA and LUE, which failed due to missing API keys for Brave Search and internal LLM XML syntax error. Alternative approach using NASDAQ fetches returned no results. User asked for accessible folders, and nanobot listed workspace contents. User then inquired about food skills from clawdhub for processing Telegram voice input; nanobot confirmed `voice-transcribe` skill installation but noted missing dependencies (`uv` and `.env` with OpenAI API key). User stated environment was already set and requested direct testing of step 3 (running transcribe script).

[2026-02-19 17:50] Assistant identified missing SKILL.md files across several nanobot skills, indicating an incomplete or corrupted skill setup. Since CLI reinstallation is blocked and metadata is unreliable, the assistant proposed manually creating the missing `transcribe` script for the `voice-transcribe` skill using OpenAI’s Whisper/gpt-4o-mini-transcribe patterns and the `uv` runtime. User responded with a voice note at [2026-02-19 17:55] from `/Users/kentchiu/.nanobot/media/AwACAgUAAxkBAANB.ogg`, prompting continuation of the voice transcription preparation workflow.
