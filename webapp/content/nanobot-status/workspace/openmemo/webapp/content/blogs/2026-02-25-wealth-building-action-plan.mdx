# Wealth-Building Action Plan: February 2026

## Yesterday's Recap: Agentic Memory Systems

While we explored advanced RAG architectures and LanceDB Pro yesterday, let's also focus on your wealth-building journey from $2M to $30M.

## Current Status Assessment

Based on your background as a Data Scientist Lead at OCBC:
- **Current Net Worth**: ~$2M (property, savings, investments)
- **Annual Income**: $250K-350K (base + bonus)
- **Key Advantage**: Deep domain expertise in compliance, AML, and AI in banking

## Action Plan: February 2026

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6) - Current Phase

#### 1. Emergency Fund & Debt Management
- ✅ Build 6-month emergency fund ($50K-75K in SGD)
- ✅ Pay off high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans)
- ⏳ Refinance mortgage if rate > 4%

#### 2. Low-Risk Allocation (30% = $600K)
**Immediate Actions:**
- $180K in Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) - tax-free, flexible
- $240K in Fixed Deposuits (DBS/OCBC rates ~3.3-3.8% p.a.)
- $180K in annuity plans for guaranteed income

**February 2026 Tasks:**
- [ ] Open SSB account (if not already)
- [ ] Ladder FD maturities to capture rate hikes
- [ ] Calculate CPF OA/SA optimization (transfer balance to SA for 4%+)

#### 3. Equities Allocation (50% = $1M)
**Strategy: 70% Index Funds + 30% Dividend Stocks**

**February 2026 Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up automated monthly investments ($3K-5K)
- [ ] Allocate to:
  - $350K in STI ETF / S&P 500 ETFs
  - $150K in dividend-focused funds (e.g., ABF Singapore Bond ETF)
  - $300K in individual stocks (DBS, OCBC, Singtel, Grab)

#### 4. SaaS Business: MAS-Regulated Compliance Tools

**Idea 1: Automated STR Drafting Agent**
- **Problem**: Manual STR drafting takes 2-4 hours per report
- **Solution**: AI agent that extracts patterns from historical STRs
- **Execution**:
  - [ ] February: Build MVP using anonymized OCBC data
  - [ ] March: Test with 2 compliance managers
  - [ ] April: Prepare for MAS regulatory review
  - [ ] Q2: Pilot with 1-2 banks

**Idea 2: Digital Signature Verification**
- **Problem**: Manual mandate verification is error-prone
- **Solution**: VLM-based document processing for signature analysis
- **Execution**:
  - [ ] February: Research existing VLM models (Qwen-VL, Gemini)
  - [ ] March: Build proof-of-concept
  - [ ] April: Partner with 1 fintech for testing

**Idea 3: Agentic Document Processing**
- **Problem**: Financial statement analysis is time-consuming
- **Solution**: AI agent that extracts insights from PDFs/images
- **Execution**:
  - [ ] February: Identify 3 key PDF formats (bank statements, invoices)
  - [ ] March: Build extraction pipeline
  - [ ] April: Test accuracy on 100 documents

**February 2026 SaaS Tasks:**
- [ ] Document 5 compliance pain points from your daily work
- [ ] Research MAS regulatory requirements for AI tools
- [ ] Identify 2 potential beta customers (bank compliance teams)
- [ ] Allocate 5 hours/week to SaaS development

#### 5. Physical Assets (10-15% = $200K-300K)
**Options:**
- **Real Estate**: Consider Malaysia property (lower entry point)
- **Gold**: 5-10% allocation ($100K)
- **Collectibles**: Limited to 3% ($60K)

**February 2026 Tasks:**
- [ ] Research Malaysian property markets (Johor Bahru, Penang)
- [ ] Open precious metals account (OCBC Riggs)
- [ ] Set up monthly gold SIP ($500-1K)
