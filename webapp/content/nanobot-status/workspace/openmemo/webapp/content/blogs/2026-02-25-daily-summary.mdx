## Technical Insight: Agentic Memory Systems (Feb 24)

Yesterday's blog explored the architecture of advanced agentic memory systems using LanceDB Pro, highlighting key components:

**Core Technologies:**
- **LanceDB** columnar format for efficient vector and full-text search
- **BM25** for sparse retrieval (exact keyword matching)
- **Hybrid fusion (Vector + BM25)** via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
- **Cross-encoder reranking** (Jina) for precision elimination of hallucinations
- **MMR diversity** to maximize information density in context windows
- **Multi-scope isolation** for security and project separation

**Key Takeaway:** Production-grade agents require more than simple vector search - they need hybrid retrieval pipelines with reranking and diversity optimization to maximize context window efficiency.

## Wealth-Building Strategy: $2M → $30M (Feb 25 Update)

### Asset Allocation Strategy

| Asset Class | Allocation | Purpose | Expected Return |
|-------------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Low-Risk (Bonds, Fixed Income) | 30% | Capital preservation | 3-5% p.a. |
| Equities (Index Funds, Stocks) | 50% | Growth | 8-12% p.a. |
| Venture Capital / Startups | 20% | High growth | 15-30%+ p.a. |
| Physical Assets (Real Estate, Gold) | 10-15% | Inflation hedge | 5-10% p.a. |
| SaaS Business | Variable | Passive income | 20-50%+ p.a. |

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6) - **Current Phase**

**Immediate Actions:**
- Build emergency fund (6 months expenses)
- Pay off high-interest debt
- Set up automated investments for the 30% low-risk allocation
- Establish financial tracking system (Net worth, passive income coverage)

**February 2026 Focus Areas:**
1. **Low-Risk (30% = $600K)**: SSB, Fixed Deposits, Annuities
2. **Equities (50% = $1M)**: STI ETF, S&P 500, Dividend Stocks
3. **SaaS Business**: MAS-Regulated Compliance Tools (5 hours/week)
4. **Physical Assets**: Malaysian property, Gold SIP

**Singapore-Specific Opportunities:**
- CPF OA/SA optimization for tax efficiency
- S-REITs for income generation
- Local startup ecosystem for VC exposure (leveraging your FinTech network)

### SaaS Business Focus: MAS-Regulated Compliance Tools

Leverage your OCBC expertise to build:
1. **Automated STR drafting tools** - AI agents for Suspicious Transaction Reports
2. **Digital signature mandate verification** - Document processing for compliance
3. **Agentic document processing** - Insight extraction from PDFs/images

**February 2026 Execution Steps:**
1. Document 5 compliance pain points from your current work
2. Research MAS regulatory requirements for AI tools
3. Identify 2 potential beta customers (bank compliance teams)
4. Allocate 5 hours/week to SaaS development

### Key Metrics to Track (Monthly)

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Emergency Fund | 6 months expenses | Monthly |
| Low-risk allocation | 30% | Monthly |
| SaaS Development | 5 hours/week | Weekly |
| Net worth growth | 1.5% p.a. | Monthly |
