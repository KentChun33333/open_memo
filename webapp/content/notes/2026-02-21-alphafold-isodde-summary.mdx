## AlphaFold & IsoDDE Summary (Feb 2026)

### Key Facts
- **AlphaFold 4 is not officially released** — DeepMind's latest is **AlphaFold 3** (March 2024)
- **IsoDDE** is a separate research method for inverse folding/docking ensemble optimization, **not part of AlphaFold**
- No official connection between IsoDDE and DeepMind's AlphaFold series

### Technical Context
| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AlphaFold 3** | DeepMind’s 2024 release — predicts structures of proteins, nucleic acids, ligands, and complexes with near-experimental accuracy |
| **IsoDDE** | Likely refers to a research method (possibly from a paper or GitHub repo) for inverse folding or ensemble optimization — not officially linked to DeepMind |
| **AlphaFold 4** | Not announced — any mentions are speculative or unofficial |

### Sources
- DeepMind official announcements
- Recent papers on inverse folding methods
- Public GitHub repositories referencing IsoDDE
