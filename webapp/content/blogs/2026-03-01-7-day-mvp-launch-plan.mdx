# 🚀 7-Day MVP Launch Plan: Generate Revenue in 1 Week

**Goal**: Generate initial cash flow ($1K–$2K) within 7 days using existing OCBC compliance AI expertise.

---

## 🎯 **MVP Idea: AI Compliance Audit Report Generator**

**Problem**: Small FinTechs and borrowers spend 4–8 hours preparing compliance documentation for MAS audits.

**Solution**: AI tool that auto-generates compliance audit reports from uploaded documents (PDFs, spreadsheets, forms).

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Leverages existing OCBC compliance AI IP (STR drafting, document processing)
- ✅ Low regulatory barrier (selling a tool, not providing regulated advice)
- ✅ High perceived value ($500–$2K per report)
- ✅ Quick to build (use existing code + templates)
- ✅ First customers in your network (FinTechs, compliance teams)

---

## 📅 **Day-by-Day Execution Plan**

### **Day 1: Define MVP Scope + Landing Page**
**Time**: 2–3 hours

- [ ] Create Notion landing page with:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution demo (screenshot/mockup)
  - Pricing: $500/report (early adopter discount)
  - Contact form (Typeform or Notion form)
- [ ] Add UTM tracking for outreach

**Deliverable**: Scope doc + Notion page live

### **Day 2: Outreach to 20–30 Contacts**
**Time**: 3–4 hours

  - Template: 
    ```
    Hi [Name], I'm building an AI tool that auto-generates compliance audit reports from documents. 
    It could save your team 4–8 hours per audit. Would you be open to a 15-min demo? 
    First 3 customers get 50% off ($250/report).
    ```
- [ ] Track responses in Airtable/Notion database

**Deliverable**: 5–10 warm leads, 2–3 demo requests

---

### **Day 3: Build Minimal Demo (Use Existing Code)**
**Time**: 4–6 hours  
**Actions**:
- [ ] Use existing OCBC code for document processing (PDF parsing, VLM signature verification)
- [ ] Create simple Streamlit app:
  - Upload PDF → AI extracts key fields → Generates audit report template
  - Output: PDF report with compliance findings
- [ ] Add 2–3 pre-built templates (MAS AML/KYC checklist, transaction monitoring report)
- [ ] Test with dummy data (anonymized OCBC examples)

**Deliverable**: Working prototype you can demo to beta customers

---

### **Day 4: Beta Customer Validation**
**Time**: 2–3 hours  
**Actions**:
- [ ] Schedule 2–3 demos with interested contacts
- [ ] Demo script:
  1. Show problem (manual audit prep takes 4–8 hours)
  2. Show your solution (upload → AI → report in 10 mins)
  3. Ask: "Would this save you time? What features matter most?"
- [ ] Collect feedback: What to improve? What's missing?
- [ ] Get 2–3 committed beta users (agree to pay $500/report)

**Deliverable**: 2–3 committed beta customers, feedback notes

---

### **Day 5: Pricing + Payment Setup**

  - Annual subscription: $10K/year (unlimited reports)
- [ ] Set up payment link:
  - Stripe payment link or BOU payment QR
  - Send invoice via PDF generator (use existing code)
- [ ] Create automated onboarding flow:
  - Customer pays → You get notification → You generate report → Deliver via email

**Deliverable**: Payment link + automated onboarding ready

---

### **Day 6: Launch → Collect First Revenue**

|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Revenue** | $1K–$2K possible in Week 1 | Start with network; low barrier to entry |
| **Full SaaS MVP** | 4–6 weeks minimum | Use Week 1 for validation first |
| **Scale to $10K/mo** | 3–6 months | Add templates, hire dev, marketing |
| **Regulatory clearance** | Not needed for tool (not regulated advice) | Avoid providing regulated advice; sell tool only |
