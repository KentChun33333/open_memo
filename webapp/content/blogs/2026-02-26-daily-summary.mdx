# Daily Summary: February 25-26, 2026

## Technical Insight: Agentic Architecture (Feb 24-25)

Yesterday's blogs explored the architecture of agentic systems, focusing on key components:

**Agent Loop Architecture:**
- **Perception**: Multi-scope memory retrieval using LanceDB Pro
- **Reasoning**: Hybrid fusion (Vector + BM25) with MMR diversity
- **Action**: Step-executor framework with termination guards
- **Memory**: Long-term storage with cross-encoder reranking (Jina)

**Key Takeaway:** Production-grade agents require闭环 architecture with proper termination conditions, diversity optimization, and security isolation between scopes.
