1. Summary Checklist for Agent Interventions
Be Assertive: Use "Must," "Now," and "Do not ask."

Demand Evidence: Never accept "I have done it" without a tool output (like ls or cat).

Limit Turns: Never let an intervention loop more than twice; otherwise, the LLM starts "loop-hallucinating" (repeating the same mistake forever).
