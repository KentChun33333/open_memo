## Technical Insight: Agentic Memory Systems (Feb 24)

Yesterday's blog explored the architecture of advanced agentic memory systems using LanceDB Pro, highlighting key components:

**Core Technologies:**
- **LanceDB** columnar format for efficient vector and full-text search
- **BM25** for sparse retrieval (exact keyword matching)
- **Hybrid fusion (Vector + BM25)** via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
- **Cross-encoder reranking** (Jina) for precision elimination of hallucinations
- **MMR diversity** to maximize information density in context windows
- **Multi-scope isolation** for security and project separation

**Key Takeaway:** Production-grade agents require more than simple vector search - they need hybrid retrieval pipelines with reranking and diversity optimization to maximize context window efficiency.
