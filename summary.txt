STEP 5 COMPLETE - MCP Web Artifact Builder
================================

SUCCESS: Successfully built a web artifact demonstrating the Model Context Protocol using the web-artifacts-builder skill.

What was accomplished:
1. Verified the mcp-demo project was already properly set up with React, TypeScript, Vite, and shadcn/ui components
2. Confirmed the PostCSS configuration was properly set up (.postcssrc with JSON format, no conflicting postcss.config.js)
3. Executed the bundle-artifact.sh script from the skill directory
4. Successfully bundled the application into a self-contained HTML file (bundle.html, 262KB)

Key files created/modified:
- mcp-demo/bundle.html (262KB) - Complete MCP demo artifact with all dependencies inlined
- mcp-demo/README.md - Updated with proper documentation
- step5_status.json - Status marker for Step 5

The artifact includes:
- Server connection capabilities
- Tool discovery functionality
- Tool execution interface with parameter inputs
- Real-time activity logging
- Modern UI using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components

The model context protocol demo is now ready as a self-contained HTML artifact that can be used in Claude conversations.
